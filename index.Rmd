## Overview

Using shiny app, we want to demonstrate that, means of simulated samples
drawn from a given population is normally distributed, even though the original
population follows distributions other than normal. In this case, we will use 
populations that follows exponential distribution with $\mu = 50$ and rate 
parameter $\lambda = 1/50 = 0.02$.

## Simulated Sample Means Follow Normal Distribution

From the [shinyApp](https://ooluwole.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp/), 
the means of simulated samples follows normal distribution; **Gaussian curve**.
Also, as the sample size increases, the overall mean approximates population true
mean.This demonstrates the central limit theorem 
that states; large number of samples will approximate the true expected values 
(mean) of population where the samples were drawn from.
